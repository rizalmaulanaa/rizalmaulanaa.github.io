Hi, my name is Rizal Maulana and I'm a Computer Science graduate student at Universitas Indonesia. I already got my Bachelor's degree at Universitas Brawijaya with an Informatics Engineering major. I had a solid extra-curricular experience during my undergraduate program. During the graduate program, I have a conference publication regarding Biomedical Image Analysis. I also have experience in becoming a teaching assistant for Advance Machine Learning course in three semesters. Furthermore, I have been a speaker on Biomedical Image Segmentation (Brain MRI to be specific). My research interest are Biomedical Image Analysis, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision.
