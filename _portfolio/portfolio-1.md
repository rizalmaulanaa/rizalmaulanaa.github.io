This code are modified and combine code from [Probabilistic-Unet-Pytorch](https://github.com/stefanknegt/Probabilistic-Unet-Pytorch) and [MCTrans](https://github.com/JiYuanFeng/MCTrans). Basically this code add a probabilistic model from Probabilistic U-Net into transformer-based model MCTrans. In previous study, model MCTrans can solved long-range dependencies problem and model Probabilistic U-Net can capture ambiguity in biomedical image. For installation, you can check [MCTrans](https://github.com/JiYuanFeng/MCTrans) repository.
